Object Oriented Class Projects
These are some java projects from the beginning of my Object-Oriented Programming class at UCF. They start off simple and get progressively more complex.
Most of these are focused on Java concepts and nothing strictly Object-Oriented; for more of that type of work, see "Object-Oriented Java"
